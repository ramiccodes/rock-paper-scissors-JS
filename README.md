# rock-paper-scissors-JS
This is a Rock Paper Scissors program exercise, courtesy of The Odin Project. 

Initially, this RPS program was only meant to be played on the console, so to display the results, I had to use "console.log" for the initial version of
this project that the Odin Project wants you to make.

I started to work on that first version on (June 14, 2022) and finished on (June 16, 2022). I documented this process on my instagram account, @ramiccodes

After tackling the "DOM Manipulation and Events" section of The Odin Project, they asked to convert the program into a game that can be played on the browser,
complete with graphics and results that are displayed on the screen after 5 rounds.

I started to modify the program on (June 23, 2022) and finished/committed on (June 26, 2022). I also documented my process of making this on my instagram
account, @ramiccodes
